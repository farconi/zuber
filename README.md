| Zuber cabs in Chicago | Zuber hired us as a data analyst to mine a database with detailed information about cab rides in Chicago. Our job is to identify patterns and trends in rides, understand rider preferences and investigate the impact of external factors, such as weather, on trip frequency. Based on this information, Zuber expects to make strategic decisions to provide an efficient and high quality ridesharing service. | *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *numpy*, *scipy* and *PostgreSQL*|
